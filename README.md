# MentalHealth_inTheWorkplace

## Value of Study
Mental health refers to a state of being able to cope with everyday challenges, work efficiently, attain one's full potential, and contribute to one's company. In a workspace environment, along with physical health and social well-being, mental health became a top priority for businesses to assist their employees to sustain a high performance while maintaining a positive mental health. Yet, the mental health problems may be harder to detect by oneself and he/she may feel uncomfortable to share the issue or ask for help. In some cases, they feel unsupported by their employers when they express themselves in their hard times. 

As this problem worsens , we would like to study whether mental health interferes with work performance as well as how much it interferes. Furthermore, we are hoping to answer if the employees have realized the mental condition and sought treatments or ask their coworkers or supervisors for help; if employees received any mental support from their employers; do they feel released or motivated after they received support from their employer.

From the study, we hope to find the main causes for mental health problems and possible suggestions for recovery. This way can not only ensure the workers have enough resources and do their jobs effectively, but also create a more vulnerable, compassionate and sustainable workplace. In the long term, this can help build up better communications, responsiveness and mental health culture in the organization. We intend to create a comprehensive study that will be useful and presentable to possible stakeholders of this use case such as business leaders, those responsible for HR policies, and employees that share this experience in their own respective workplace.

## Goals
1. What demographics or characteristics, if any, contribute to an employee’s willingness to seek mental health treatment?
2. What factors in the workplace can leaders in organizations change to make it a safer place for their employees to work?

## Insights from Classification 

Using our interpretation of the Logistic Regression coefficients, we provide the following insights: 
* work_interfere: This is the largest coefficient. Employees who feel that their life and performance at work is affected by issues in their mental health are more likely to seek treatment for their mental health. This serves to be an opportunity for leaders in the workforce to be intentional towards employees who express this. Indicators such as sudden performance drops or even an explicit response from a monthly survey could assist leaders in understanding which employees fit under this umbrella.
* age_range : Age is the second largest coefficient of our model. Employees who are older are actually more likely to seek mental health treatment. This should be a significant insight to workforce leaders to not overlook employees just because of older age. Workforce managers and HR should offer mental health programs and outreach for employees of catered to their ages.

* benefits_Yes: Organizations who do offer mental health benefits have employees who are more likely to seek mental health treatment than organizations who don’t. This sheds more light onto how vital it is for employers to establish programs that aid employees’ mental health.
